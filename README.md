# Week 6 Challenge
**Radium Rocket's Become a Software Developer course - Week 6 (JS Async & POO)**  

This project consists in replicating the snake game using Canvas by following the "Juegos Canvas Ninja" tutorial and adding an additional functionality at the end.

That functionality has to add the tipical fruit that aleatorily appears in the grid and gives bonus points to the player without increasing the length of the snake.  

The lines of code added to fullfill the challenge are all commented after the line with //---Challenge line---
